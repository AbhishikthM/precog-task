# Indian courts anaysis and classification



Brief description of the project: the goal of the project is to preprocess the given data that is based on various cases and find insights about the data during the first stage of the project using pandas and numpy. later , a classifier is to be built, which uses the insights from the analysis and prerocessing to categorize the data into different types (this is to be done using the pytorch library)
